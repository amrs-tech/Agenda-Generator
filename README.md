# Agenda Generator 
Simple Django webapp to get a presentation file(ppt) to generate the Agenda for that presentation.

## Packages to install
* Django
* python-pptx

## How it works
It is a simple page that shows up at home. 
It asks for the user to upload a presentation file.
Once the user uploads the file he/she can click a link below to view the agenda of the respective presentation.

## Contributions
This is my first webapp in Django. Please feel free to contribute by creating issues or making PRs.
Happy coding :)
